# random-security-work
This repo is a catch-all for any random one-off security tools, tricks, and errata I've created.

<b>cryptobreak</b> - old grad school project. Given encalg, IV, and the ciphertext, we needed to write decalg to break it.

<b>dnsspoof.py</b> - a simple DNS spoofer.

<b>scbf.c</b> - shift cipher brute-forcer.

<b>StegoChat</b> - sends hidden messages by modifying the TTL times of packets. A great example of the basics of steganography.
