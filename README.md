# random-security-work
This repo is a catch-all for any random one-off security tools, tricks, and errata I've created.

cryptobreak - Project: given encalg, IV, and the ciphertext, we needed to write decalg to break it.

Dnsspoof.py - a simple DNS spoofer.

scbf.c - shift cipher brute-forcer.

StegoChat - sends hidden messages by modifying the TTL times of packets. A great example of the basics of steganography.
